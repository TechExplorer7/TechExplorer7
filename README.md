# Hi, I'm TechExplorer! ✨

I'm a systems engineer passionate about web application development. I have experience working on both the front-end and back-end, primarily using React for the front-end and Node.js (Express) for the back-end. In the past, I've also worked with Python for data analysis and PHP (Laravel) for web development.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I'm currently focused on enhancing my front-end skills, diving into technologies like React, TypeScript, and Clean Architecture. I'm dedicated to writing better code and continuously improving as a full-stack engineer.

## 🏆 Goals

My goal is to grow as a full-stack engineer by constantly learning and applying new technologies to build high-quality web applications. 🚀
